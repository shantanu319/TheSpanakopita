		"article" : "Welcome to the Spanakopita Review. Today we will be covering the controversial Tug-Of-War game that took place on October 11, 2021. In an unexpected turn of events, the juniors were disqualified and the seniors won. Based on survey results, almost 100% of the student population had expected the freshmen to dominate in this competition. Why, then, did they come in third place, just above the disqualified juniors? Our thorough analysis hypothesized that the seniors actually rigged the competition. After blood tests were conducted, an astonishingly high calcium level proved that seniors had cheated by drinking unauthorized quantities of milk. Additionally, high tensions between insert staff name here and insert junior name here resulted in the juniors being unfairly disqualified. This is a continuation from the feud two years ago, when the juniors, then freshmen, were also disqualified. We humbly ask our readers to not be swayed by the madness surrounding the first Homecoming competition and rise up against the injustice of society. On a side note, we also discovered that the sophomores do not actually exist, and are actually an alien society trying to take over Gunn. Join us next time on the Spanakopita Review."
